### Cost-Saving Strategies
1. **Bulk Purchasing**: Order all units simultaneously to negotiate volume discounts
2. **Shared Infrastructure**: Design shared water, septic, and electrical systems
3. **Self-Help Construction**: Incorporate volunteer labor through self-help housing programs
4. **Phased Development**: Build units in phases to spread costs over time
5. **Prefab vs. Custom**: Choose prefabricated units over custom-built to reduce costs
6. **Rehabilitation**: Consider rehabilitating the existing 1950 structure as one of the units

## 4. Land Trust and Limited-Equity Cooperative Models

### Community Land Trust (CLT) Structure
1. **Ownership Model**: Nonprofit CLT owns the land; residents own buildings
2. **Governance**: Typically tripartite board with residents, community members, and public representatives
3. **Affordability Mechanism**: 99-year renewable ground leases with resale restrictions
4. **Monthly Costs**: Residents pay modest ground lease fee (e.g., $60/month)
5. **Examples in Utah**: Moab Area Community Land Trust, Mountainlands Community Housing Trust (Park City)

### Limited-Equity Cooperative (LEC) Structure
1. **Ownership Model**: Residents purchase shares in the cooperative rather than individual units
2. **Governance**: Democratic one-member, one-vote decision-making
3. **Affordability Mechanism**: Resale formula limits equity appreciation
4. **Monthly Costs**: Members pay monthly fees to cover common expenses
5. **Legal Structure**: Uniform Limited Cooperative Association under Utah law

### Proposed Combined CLT-LEC Model for This Project
1. **Land Ownership**: Form a community land trust to own the 1.33-acre property
2. **Building Ownership**: Establish a limited-equity cooperative to own the five tiny homes
3. **Governance**: Create a board with representatives from both residents and community
4. **Affordability Controls**: Implement both ground lease restrictions and share price limitations
5. **Legal Formation**: Establish as separate but complementary legal entities

### Implementation Steps
1. Form nonprofit organization for the CLT
2. Register as a Uniform Limited Cooperative Association for the LEC
3. Develop bylaws, ground lease terms, and resale formulas
4. Establish resident selection criteria and process
5. Create management and maintenance plans

## 8. Conclusion

The property at 3277 N Spring Glen Road presents a viable opportunity for developing an innovative affordable housing project using a combined land trust and limited-equity cooperative model. While there are challenges related to zoning requirements and development costs, these can be addressed through careful planning, strategic partnerships, and appropriate funding sources.

The proposed development would not only provide affordable housing for 5+ households but would also establish a replicable model for rural communities throughout Utah. By separating land ownership from building ownership and limiting equity appreciation, the project can ensure long-term affordability while still providing residents with the benefits of homeownership.

With the growing interest in community land trusts across Utah and the availability of both federal and state funding for rural affordable housing, this is an opportune time to pursue this innovative approach to addressing housing affordability challenges in Carbon County.
