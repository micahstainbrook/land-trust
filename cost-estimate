## Construction Cost Estimates

### Tiny Home Construction (Per Unit)

Based on 2025 pricing data for Utah:

| Size Category | Square Footage | Prefab Cost | Custom-Built Cost |
|---------------|---------------|-------------|-------------------|
| Small | 90-250 sq ft | $15,000-$50,000 | $30,000-$70,000 |
| Medium | 250-300 sq ft | $30,000-$80,000 | $50,000-$125,000 |

### Recommended Size for Carbon County Requirements

Carbon County zoning requires a minimum building size of 600-720 sq ft for residential structures, which exceeds traditional tiny home sizes. Options include:

1. **Modified Tiny Home Design (600 sq ft)**: 
   - Prefab: $90,000-$150,000 per unit
   - Custom-built: $150,000-$270,000 per unit

2. **Variance Request for Smaller Structures**:
   - If approved, medium-sized tiny homes (250-300 sq ft) could be built
   - Prefab: $30,000-$80,000 per unit
   - Custom-built: $50,000-$125,000 per unit

### Foundation Costs

- Concrete slab foundation: $6-$14 per square foot
- For a 600 sq ft structure: $3,600-$8,400 per unit
- For a 300 sq ft structure: $1,800-$4,200 per unit

### Infrastructure Costs (Total Project)

| Item | Estimated Cost |
|------|---------------|
| Water connections | $5,000-$15,000 |
| Septic system (if needed) | $6,000-$20,000 |
| Electrical connections | $5,000-$10,000 |
| Site preparation | $10,000-$25,000 |
| Access road/driveway | $5,000-$15,000 |
| Landscaping | $3,000-$10,000 |

## Total Project Cost Estimates

### Option 1: Five 600 sq ft Units (Meeting County Size Requirements)

| Item | Low Estimate | High Estimate |
|------|-------------|--------------|
| 5 Prefab Units (600 sq ft) | $450,000 | $750,000 |
| Foundations | $18,000 | $42,000 |
| Infrastructure | $34,000 | $95,000 |
| **Total Project Cost** | **$502,000** | **$887,000** |
| **Cost Per Unit** | **$100,400** | **$177,400** |

### Option 2: Five 300 sq ft Units (If Variance Approved)

| Item | Low Estimate | High Estimate |
|------|-------------|--------------|
| 5 Prefab Units (300 sq ft) | $150,000 | $400,000 |
| Foundations | $9,000 | $21,000 |
| Infrastructure | $34,000 | $95,000 |
| **Total Project Cost** | **$193,000** | **$516,000** |
| **Cost Per Unit** | **$38,600** | **$103,200** |

## Cost-Saving Strategies

1. **Bulk Purchasing**: Order all units simultaneously to negotiate volume discounts
2. **Shared Infrastructure**: Design shared water, septic, and electrical systems
3. **Self-Help Construction**: Incorporate volunteer labor through self-help housing programs
4. **Phased Development**: Build units in phases to spread costs over time
5. **Prefab vs. Custom**: Choose prefabricated units over custom-built to reduce costs
6. **Grant Funding**: Apply for USDA Rural Development grants and other funding sources
7. **Rehabilitation**: Consider rehabilitating the existing 1950 structure as one of the units

## Additional Considerations

1. **Permitting Costs**: $1,000-$5,000 for the entire project
2. **Architectural/Engineering Fees**: $5,000-$15,000 if custom designs are needed
3. **Land Trust Setup Costs**: $3,000-$10,000 for legal fees and documentation
4. **Limited-Equity Cooperative Formation**: $2,000-$8,000 for legal structure setup

## Conclusion

The most cost-effective approach would be to pursue a zoning variance to allow smaller structures (300 sq ft range), which would significantly reduce construction costs. If this is not possible, the 600 sq ft units would comply with county requirements but at substantially higher costs.

The estimated total project cost ranges from approximately $193,000 (for smaller units with a variance) to $887,000 (for larger units meeting current requirements), with a per-unit cost ranging from $38,600 to $177,400.
