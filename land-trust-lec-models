# Land Trust and Limited-Equity Cooperative Models for 3277 N Spring Glen Road

## Community Land Trust (CLT) Model

### Overview
A community land trust is a nonprofit organization that owns land and leases it to individuals who own the buildings on that land. This model separates land ownership from building ownership to create permanently affordable housing.

### Key Features of Community Land Trusts
1. **Land Ownership Structure**: The nonprofit CLT owns the land permanently, while residents own the buildings
2. **Long-term Land Lease**: Typically 99-year renewable ground leases
3. **Resale Restrictions**: When homeowners sell, there are restrictions on the sale price to maintain affordability
4. **Monthly Land Lease Fee**: Homeowners pay a modest monthly fee (e.g., $60/month in Moab example)
5. **Governance Structure**: CLTs typically have a tripartite board with:
   - Residents of CLT properties
   - Community members
   - Public representatives or experts

### Examples in Utah
1. **Moab Area Community Land Trust**
   - First project: Arroyo Crossing (41 acres)
   - 300-unit subdivision with various housing types
   - Utilized USDA mutual self-help program
   - Partners with Housing Authority of Southeastern Utah and Community Rebuilds

2. **Mountainlands Community Housing Trust (Park City)**
   - Utah's first community land trust
   - Began in early 2000s
   - Focuses on resort community affordability challenges

### Legal Formation in Utah
1. Form a nonprofit 501(c)(3) organization
2. Develop bylaws and governance structure
3. Establish ground lease terms and resale formulas
4. Create homeowner selection criteria and process
5. Secure land through purchase, donation, or partnership with local government

## Limited-Equity Cooperative (LEC) Model

### Overview
A limited equity cooperative is a homeownership model where residents purchase a share in a development (rather than an individual unit) and commit to resell their share at a price determined by a formulaâ€”maintaining affordability over the long term.

### Key Features of Limited-Equity Cooperatives
1. **Shared Ownership**: Residents own shares in the cooperative, not individual units
2. **Democratic Governance**: One member, one vote decision-making structure
3. **Resale Formula**: Limits equity appreciation to maintain affordability
4. **Monthly Fees**: Members pay monthly fees to cover common expenses
5. **Initial Affordability**: Often achieved through government assistance, subsidies, or low-interest financing

### Formation Process
1. Establish a Uniform Limited Cooperative Association under Utah law
2. Create bylaws and governance structure
3. Determine share pricing and resale formula
4. Establish eligibility requirements (typically income-based)
5. Secure financing for property acquisition

### Local Government Support Options
1. **Public Financing**: Below-market loans or grants
2. **Property Tax Breaks**: Special tax classifications for LECs
3. **Rights of First Refusal**: Laws giving tenant associations opportunity to purchase properties
4. **Support for Nonprofit Partners**: Financial support for organizations that help establish LECs
